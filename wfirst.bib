	abstract = {Context. Earth-sized planets around nearby stars are being detected for the first time by ground-based radial velocity and space-based transit surveys. This milestone is opening the path toward the definition of instruments able to directly detect the light from these planets, with the identification of bio-signatures as one of the main objectives. In that respect, both the European Space Agency (ESA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) have identified nulling interferometry as one of the most promising techniques. The ability to study distant planets will however depend on the amount of exozodiacal dust in the habitable zone of the target stars. Aims: We assess the impact of exozodiacal clouds on the performance of an infrared nulling interferometer in the Emma X-array configuration. The first part of the study is dedicated to the effect of the disc brightness on the number of targets that can be surveyed and studied by spectroscopy during the mission lifetime. In the second part, we address the impact of asymmetric structures in the discs such as clumps and offset which can potentially mimic the planetary signal. Methods: We use the DarwinSIM software which was designed and validated to study the performance of space-based nulling interferometers. The software has been adapted to handle images of exozodiacal discs and to compute the corresponding demodulated signal. Results: For the nominal mission architecture with 2-m aperture telescopes, centrally symmetric exozodiacal dust discs about 100 times denser than the solar zodiacal cloud can be tolerated in order to survey at least 150 targets during the mission lifetime. Considering modeled resonant structures created by an Earth-like planet orbiting at 1 AU around a Sun-like star, we show that this tolerable dust density goes down to about 15 times the solar zodiacal density for face-on systems and decreases with the disc inclination. Conclusions: Whereas the disc brightness only affects the integration time, the presence of clumps or offset is more problematic and can hamper the planet detection. Based on the worst-case scenario for debris disc structures, the upper limit on the tolerable exozodiacal dust density is approximately 15 times the density of the solar zodiacal cloud. This gives the typical sensitivity that we will need to reach on exozodiacal discs in order to prepare the scientific programme of future Earth-like planet characterisation missions.

These grains are expected to be continuously replenished by the collisions and evaporation of larger bodies just as in our solar zodiacal cloud. Exozodiacal clouds (“exozodis”) must therefore be seriously taken into account when attempting to directly image faint Earth-like planets (exoEarths, for short). This paper summarizes the oral contributions and discussions that took place during the Satellite Meeting on exozodiacal dust disks, in an attempt to address the following two questions: Do we need to solve the exozodi question?

Current detection limits are several orders of magnitude above the level of the Solar System's Zodiacal cloud, so characterisation of the brightness distribution of exo-zodi down to much fainter levels is needed. To this end, the large Binocular Telescope Interferometer (LBTI) will detect thermal emission from habitable zone exo-zodi a few times brighter than Solar System levels. Here we present a modelling framework for interpreting LBTI observations, which yields dust levels from detections and upper limits that are then converted into predictions and upper limits for the scattered light surface brightness. We apply this model to the HOSTS survey sample of nearby stars; assuming a null depth uncertainty of 10\${\textasciicircum}\{-4\}\$ the LBTI will be sensitive to dust a few times above the Solar System level around Sun-like stars, and to even lower dust levels for more massive stars.},

We suggest that the heterogeneity in albedo spectra and planet/star flux ratios as a function of orbital distance, planet mass, and composition expected for the giant exoplanets at separations from their primaries accessible to WFIRST will provide unique constraints on giant planet atmospheres, evolution, aerosol and cloud properties, and general theory. Such exoplanets are not merely extrapolations of Jupiter and Saturn, but are likely to occupy a rich continuum of varied behaviors. Each in themselves and jointly, optical spectra, photometry, and polarization measurements of a diverse population of giant exoplanets in the solar neighborhood has the potential to reveal a multitude of fundamental features of their gas-giant chemistry, atmospheres, and formation. Such a campaign will enrich our understanding of this class of planets beyond what is possible with even a detailed exploration of the giants in our own solar system, and will compliment ongoing studies of exoplanets in the infrared and on close-in orbits inaccessible to coronagraphy.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.8440},
	abstract = {We explored two aspects of the problem of characterizing cool extrasolar giant planets in scattered optical light with a space based coronagraph. First, for a number of the known radial velocity (RV) giants we computed traditional forward models of their atmospheric structure and clouds, given various input assumptions, and computed model albedo spectra. Such models have been computed before, but mostly for generic planets. Our new models demonstrate that there is likely interesting spectral diversity among those planets that are most favorable for direct detection. Second, we applied a powerful Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) retrieval technique to synthetic noisy data of cool giants to better understand how well various atmospheric parameters--particularly molecular abundances and cloud properties--could be constrained. This is the first time such techniques have been applied to this problem. The process is time consuming, so only a dozen or so cases could be completed in the limited time available. Nevertheless the results clearly show that even at S/N {\textasciitilde} 5, scientifically interesting and valuable conclusions can be drawn about the properties of giant planet atmospheres from noisy spectra. We find that atmospheric abundances are best constrained when the planet gravity is bounded. Thus direct imaging observations of known radial velocity planets are extremely valuable as limits on a target planet's gravity can be obtained from astrometric imaging and reflectivity and mass-radius relationship arguments (for mass and radius, respectively). Further retrieval studies are clearly warranted and would be valuable to help guide instrument design decisions.},

	abstract = {Future direct-imaging exoplanet missions such as WFIRST/AFTA, Exo-C, and Exo-S will measure the reflectivity of exoplanets at visible wavelengths. The exoplanets to be observed will be located further away from their parent stars than is Earth from the Sun. These "cold" exoplanets have atmospheric environments conducive for the formation of water and/or ammonia clouds, like Jupiter in the Solar System. We study the science return from direct-imaging exoplanet missions, focusing on the exoplanet atmospheric compositions. First, the study shows that a low-resolution (R=70) reflection spectrum of a giant exoplanet at 600 - 1000 nm, for a moderate signal-to-noise ratio of 20, will allow measurements of both the pressure of the uppermost cloud deck and the mixing ratio of methane, if the uppermost cloud deck is located at the pressure level of 0.6 - 1.5 bars. Further increasing the signal-to-noise ratio can improve the measurement range of the cloud deck pressure to 0.2 - 4 bars. The strong and the weak absorption bands of methane allow the simultaneous measurements of cloud and gas; when the uppermost cloud deck is located shallower than the pressure level of 0.2, the weak bands are muted, and the cloud deck pressure and the mixing ratio of methane are not distinguishable from a single reflection spectrum. Second, future direct-imaging exoplanet missions may detect the broadband reflectivity of a few super-Earth exoplanets. If having H2O-dominated atmospheres, directly imaged super Earths are likely to have water clouds located shallower than 1E-3 bars. The very high clouds on these planets would mute most gas absorption features except for H2O, and these planets would occupy a confined phase space in the color-color diagrams.},

	abstract = {The Keck Interferometer Nuller (KIN) was used to survey 25 nearby main sequence stars in the mid-infrared, in order to assess the prevalence of warm circumstellar (exozodiacal) dust around nearby solar-type stars. The KIN measures circumstellar emission by spatially blocking the star but transmitting the circumstellar flux in a region typically 0.1 - 4 AU from the star. We find one significant detection (eta Crv), two marginal detections (gamma Oph and alpha Aql), and 22 clear non-detections. Using a model of our own Solar System's zodiacal cloud, scaled to the luminosity of each target star, we estimate the equivalent number of target zodis needed to match our observations. Our three zodi detections are eta Crv (1250 +/- 260), gamma Oph (200 +/- 80) and alpha Aql (600 +/- 200), where the uncertainties are 1-sigma. The 22 non-detected targets have an ensemble weighted average consistent with zero, with an average individual uncertainty of 160 zodis (1-sigma). These measurements represent the best limits to date on exozodi levels for a sample of nearby main sequence stars. A statistical analysis of the population of 23 stars not previously known to contain circumstellar dust (excluding eta Crv and gamma Oph) suggests that, if the measurement errors are uncorrelated (for which we provide evidence) and if these 23 stars are representative of a single class with respect to the level of exozodi brightness, the mean exozodi level for the class is {\textless}150 zodis (3-sigma upper-limit, corresponding to 99\% confidence under the additional assumption that the measurement errors are Gaussian). We also demonstrate that this conclusion is largely independent of the shape and mean level of the (unknown) true underlying exozodi distribution.},

Here, we develop an instrument noise model suitable for studying the spectral characterization potential of a coronagraph-equipped, space-based telescope. We adopt a baseline set of telescope and instrument parameters, including a 2 m diameter primary aperture, an operational wavelength range of 0.4-1.0 um, and an instrument spectral resolution of 70, and apply our baseline model to a variety of spectral models of different planet types, including Earth twins, Jupiter twins, and warm and cool Jupiters and Neptunes. With our exoplanet spectral models, we explore wavelength-dependent planet-star flux ratios for main sequence stars of various effective temperatures, and discuss how coronagraph inner and outer working angle constraints will influence the potential to study different types of planets. For planets most favorable to spectroscopic characterization---cool Jupiters and Neptunes as well as nearby Earth twins and super-Earths---we study the integration times required to achieve moderate signal-to-noise ratio spectra. We also explore the sensitivity of the integration times required to detect the base of key absorption bands (for methane, water vapor, and molecular oxygen) to coronagraph raw contrast performance, exozodiacal light levels, and the distance to the planetary system. Most modeled observations have noise dominated by dark current, indicating that improving CCD performance could substantially drive down requisite integration times. Finally, we briefly discuss the extension of our models to a more distant future Large UV-Optical-InfraRed (LUVOIR) mission.},

(SDT) of the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) mission. It
is a space observatory that will address the most compelling scientific
problems in dark energy, exoplanets and general astrophysics using a
2.4-m telescope with a wide-field infrared instrument and an optical
coronagraph. The Astro2010 Decadal Survey recommended a Wide Field
Infrared Survey Telescope as its top priority for a new large space
mission. As conceived by the decadal survey, WFIRST would carry out a
dark energy science program, a microlensing program to determine the
demographics of exoplanets, and a general observing program utilizing
its ultra wide field. In October 2012, NASA chartered a Science
Definition Team (SDT) to produce, in collaboration with the WFIRST Study
Office at GSFC and the Program Office at JPL, a Design Reference Mission
(DRM) for an implementation of WFIRST using one of the 2.4-m,
Hubble-quality telescope assemblies recently made available to NASA.
This DRM builds on the work of the earlier WFIRST SDT, reported by Green
et al. (2012) and the previous WFIRST-2.4 DRM, reported by Spergel et.
(2013). The 2.4-m primary mirror enables a mission with greater
sensitivity and higher angular resolution than the 1.3-m and 1.1-m
designs considered previously, increasing both the science return of the
primary surveys and the capabilities of WFIRST as a Guest Observer
facility. The addition of an on-axis coronagraphic instrument to the
baseline design enables imaging and spectroscopic studies of planets
around nearby stars.},

	title = {The {Direct} {Detectability} of {Giant} {Exoplanets} in the {Optical}},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07832},
	abstract = {Motivated by the possibility that a coronagraph will be put on WFIRST/AFTA, we explore the direct detectability of extrasolar giant planets (EGPs) in the optical. We quantify a planet's detectability by the fraction of its orbit for which it is in an observable configuration (\$f\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{obs\}\$). Using a suite of Monte Carlo experiments, we study the dependence of \$f\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{obs\}\$ upon the inner working angle (IWA) and minimum achievable contrast (\$C\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{min\}\$) of the direct-imaging observatory; the planet's phase function, geometric albedo, single-scattering albedo, radius, and distance from Earth; and the semi-major axis distribution of EGPs. We calculate phase functions for a given geometric or single-scattering albedo, assuming various scattering mechanisms. We find that the Lambertian phase function can predict significantly larger \$f\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{obs\}\$'s with respect to the more realistic Rayleigh phase function. For observations made with WFIRST/AFTA's baseline capabilities (\$C\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{min\}{\textbackslash}sim10{\textasciicircum}\{-9\}\$, \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{IWA\}{\textbackslash}sim0.2''\$), Jupiter-like planets orbiting stars within 10, 30, and 50 parsecs of Earth have volume-averaged observability fractions of \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}\$12\%, 3\%, and 0.5\%, respectively. At 10 parsecs, such observations yield \$f\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{obs\}{\textgreater}1{\textbackslash}\%\$ for low- to modest-eccentricity planets with semi-major axes in the range \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}2 - 10\$ AU. If \$C\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{min\}=10{\textasciicircum}\{-10\}\$, this range extends to \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}35\$ AU. We find that, in all but the most optimistic configurations, the probability for detection in a blind search is low (\$\{{\textless}\}{\textbackslash},5{\textbackslash}\%\$). However, with orbital parameter constraints from long-term radial-velocity campaigns and Gaia astrometry, the tools we develop in this work can be used to determine both the most promising systems to target and when to observe them.},

	abstract = {The COBE Diffuse Infrared Background Experiment (DIRBE) was designed to search for the cosmic infrared background (CIB) radiation. For an observer confined to the inner solar system, scattered light and thermal emission from the interplanetary dust (IPD) are major contributors to the diffuse sky brightness at most infrared wavelengths. Accurate removal of this zodiacal light foreground is a necessary step toward a direct measurement of the CIB. The zodiacal light foreground contribution in each of the 10 DIRBE wavelength bands ranging from 1.25 to 240 μm is distinguished by its apparent seasonal variation over the whole sky. This contribution has been extracted by fitting the brightness calculated from a parameterized physical model to the time variation of the all-sky DIRBE measurements over 10 months of liquid He cooled observations. The model brightness is evaluated as the integral along the line of sight of the product of a source function and a three-dimensional dust density distribution function. The dust density distribution is composed of multiple components: a smooth cloud, three asteroidal dust bands, and a circumsolar ring near 1 AU. By using a directly measurable quantity that relates only to the IPD cloud, we exclude other contributors to the sky brightness from the IPD model. High-quality maps of the infrared sky with the zodiacal foreground removed have been generated using the IPD model described here. Imperfections in the model reveal themselves as low-level systematic artifacts in the residual maps that correlate with components of the IPD. The most evident of these artifacts are located near the ecliptic plane in the mid-IR and are less than 2\% of the zodiacal foreground brightness. Uncertainties associated with the model are discussed, including implications for the CIB search.},

The prospect of extreme high-contrast astronomical imaging from space has inspired developments of new coronagraph methods for exoplanet imaging and spectroscopy. However, the requisite imaging contrast, at levels of 1 billion to one or better for the direct imaging of cool mature exoplanets in reflected visible starlight, leads to challenging new requirements on the stability and control of the optical wavefront, at levels currently beyond the reach of ground-based telescopes. We review the design, performance, and science prospects for the hybrid Lyot coronagraph (HLC) on the WFIRST-AFTA telescope. Together with a pair of deformable mirrors for active wavefront control, the HLC creates a full 360-deg high-contrast dark field of view at 10−9 contrast levels or better, extending to within angular separations of 3 λ0/D from the central star, over spectral bandwidths of 10\% or more.},

NASA WFIRST-AFTA mission study includes a coronagraph instrument to find and characterize exoplanets.

Such masks for high-contrast internal coronagraphic imaging require various fabrication technologies to meet a wide range of specifications, including precise shapes, micron scale island features, ultralow reflectivity regions, uniformity, wave front quality, and achromaticity. We present the approaches employed at JPL to produce pupil plane and image plane coronagraph masks by combining electron beam, deep reactive ion etching, and black silicon technologies with illustrative examples of each, highlighting milestone accomplishments from the High Contrast Imaging Testbed at JPL and from the High Contrast Imaging Lab at Princeton University.},

A series of milestones were set to track the development of the technologies required for the instrument; we report on completion of WFIRST-AFTA coronagraph milestone 2—a narrowband 10−8 contrast test with static aberrations for the shaped pupil—and the plans for the upcoming broadband coronagraph milestone 5.},

K-type star. In Hatzes et al.. (2003) we confirmed the presence of the planetary companion with a minimum mass of 1.7 MJup at 2 AU. In this paper we present additional eight years of precise RV data from the Harlan J. Smith 2.7 m Telescope and its Tull Cóude spectrograph
at McDonald Observatory. The 900 d signal, that is interpreted as the presence of the giant planetary companion,is strongly confirmed by adding the new data. We present an updated orbital solution for the planet, which shows that the planet is slightly more massive and the orbit more circular than previous results have suggested. An intensive high-cadence week of RV observations in 2007 revealed that γ Cep A is a multi-periodic pulsator.

longest known for a planet orbiting an M dwarf). We update the HD 74156
double-planet system. We also announce the detection of HD 145934 b, a 2
M Jup planet in a 7.5 yr orbit around a giant star. Two of
our stars, HD 187123 and HD 217107, at present host the only known
examples of systems comprising a hot Jupiter and a planet with a well
constrained period greater than 5 yr, and with no evidence of giant
planets in between. Our enlargement and improvement of long-period
planet parameters will aid future analysis of origins, diversity, and
evolution of planetary systems.

We analyze both "specific" versions of obscurational completeness, which depend explicitly on the semimajor axis and eccentricity of companion orbits, and "ensemble" versions, which integrate over a companion population represented by probability distributions for semimajor axis and eccentricity. In the case of effectively nonmoving companions (orbital periods significantly longer than the observing program) or for a single observation, we find that high completeness requires obscurations much smaller than the smallest orbit size of interest. For example, to achieve 95\% obscurational completeness for a particular orbit size on a single visit, the obscuration must be less than \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/607/2/1003/img1.gif] img1.gif that orbit size. For relevant ensembles of terrestrial planets, an observing program can find more than 95\% of all companions in less than three visits over 3 months—if the obscuration is smaller than the smallest orbit of interest. If the obscuration is larger, but not larger than the largest orbit of interest, then the design obscurational completeness is reduced, but 95\% of all the planets that can ever be found are found by less than six visits over 2-5 yr. Nevertheless, achieving such high completeness when the ensemble is only partly resolved calls for several low-yield visits.},

	abstract = {Upcoming space-based coronagraphic instruments in the next decade will 
perform reflected light spectroscopy and photometry of cool directly
imaged extrasolar giant planets. We are developing a new atmospheric
retrieval methodology to help assess the science return and inform the
instrument design for such future missions, and ultimately interpret the
resulting observations. Our retrieval technique employs a geometric
albedo model coupled with both a Markov chain Monte Carlo Ensemble
Sampler (emcee) and a multimodal nested sampling algorithm (MultiNest)
to map the posterior distribution. This combination makes the global
evidence calculation more robust for any given model and highlights
possible discrepancies in the likelihood maps. As a proof of concept,
our current atmospheric model contains one or two cloud layers, methane
as a major absorber, and a H2-He background gas. This
6-to-9 parameter model is appropriate for Jupiter-like planets and can
be easily expanded in the future. In addition to deriving the marginal
likelihood distribution and confidence intervals for the model
parameters, we perform model selection to determine the significance of
methane and cloud detection as a function of expected signal-to-noise
ratio in the presence of spectral noise correlations. After internal
validation, the method is applied to realistic spectra of Jupiter,
Saturn, and HD 99492c, a model observing target. We find that the
presence or absence of clouds and methane can be determined with high
confidence, while parameter uncertainties are model dependent and
correlated. Such general methods will also be applicable to the
interpretation of direct imaging spectra of cloudy terrestrial planets.},

phase function in several Cassini/ISS imaging filter bandpasses. In
addition, these observations show that Jupiter’s color is more
variable with phase angle than predicted by models. Therefore, the color
of even a near Jupiter-twin planet observed at a partial phase cannot be
assumed to be comparable to that of Jupiter at full phase. We discuss

	abstract = {A warm/hot dust component (at temperature 300 K) has been detected around 20\% of A, F, G, K stars. This component is called ‘exozodiacal dust’ as it presents similarities with the zodiacal dust detected in our solar system, even though its physical properties and spatial distribution can be significantly different. Understanding the origin and evolution of this dust is of crucial importance, not only because its presence could hamper future detections of Earth-like planets in their habitable zones, but also because it can provide invaluable information about the inner regions of planetary systems. In this review, we present a detailed overview of the observational techniques used in the detection and characterisation of exozodiacal dust clouds (‘exozodis’) and the results they have yielded so far, in particular regarding the incidence rate of exozodis as a function of crucial parameters such as stellar type and age, or the presence of an outer cold debris disc. We also present the important constraints that have been obtained, on dust size distribution and spatial location, using state-of-the-art radiation transfer models on some of these systems. Finally, we investigate the crucial issue of how to explain the presence of exozodiacal dust around so many stars (regardless of their ages) despite the fact that such dust so close to its host star should disappear rapidly due to the coupled effect of collisions and stellar radiation forces. Several potential mechanisms have been proposed to solve this paradox and are reviewed in detail in this paper. The review finishes by presenting the future of this growing field.},

Photoelectric photometry of 435 stars in the 11 Selected Areas of SA 28, 29, 45, 55, 57, 71, 82, 94, 106, 107, and 118 of the MWC is given. The data are used to derive magnitude corrections to the MWC for these areas. Ten of the areas are in the Galactic meridional plane (Galactic longitudes of 0° and 180°). These are the same areas used by Becker in his Basel program of star counts for the study of Galactic structure. The first purpose of the paper is to extend the Basel star counts to fainter magnitudes. For this, 200 inch photographic plates were measured to the plate limits near B = 22, calibrated with the photoelectric photometry listed here. A second purpose is to derive certain properties of the catalog. The interests are (1) to determine the internal (random) measuring errors of the MWC as a function of magnitude after correcting for the systematic scale error in each area, (2) to test for a color equation between the corrected m pg (MWC) values and the B pe system that must be present because of the difference in reflectivity between silvered and aluminized mirrors, and (3) to test for possible distance‐to‐center corrections of the scale‐corrected MWC magnitudes. Photographic photometry is used to complete the count surveys in each of the program areas to the limit of the 200 inch plates. Color‐magnitude diagrams are shown for each area, generally complete to V = 20, B −V = 2.0. The work is preparatory to an analysis for Galactic structure when the larger database is available in a program by Majewski using Kitt Peak 4 m plates, epoch circa 1975, that will be to provide both a deeper count survey in B and V and proper motions for the larger sample.},

	abstract = {A primary goal of direct imaging techniques is to spectrally characterize the atmospheres of planets around other stars at extremely high contrast levels. To achieve this goal, coronagraphic instruments have favored integral field spectrographs (IFS) as the science cameras to disperse the entire search area at once and obtain spectra at each location, since the planet position is not known a priori. These spectrographs are useful against confusion from speckles and background objects, and can also help in the speckle subtraction and wavefront control stages of the coronagraphic observation. We present a software package, the Coronagraph and Rapid Imaging Spectrograph in Python (crispy) to simulate the IFS of the WFIRST Coronagraph Instrument (CGI). The software propagates input science cubes using spatially and spectrally resolved coronagraphic focal plane cubes, transforms them into IFS detector maps and ultimately reconstructs the spatio-spectral input scene as a 3D datacube. Simulated IFS cubes can be used to test data extraction techniques, refine sensitivity analyses and carry out design trade studies of the flight CGI-IFS instrument. crispy is a publicly available Python package and can be adapted to other IFS designs.},

The result embodied in this handbook is a top-level implementation approach on the practice of systems engineering unique to NASA. Material used for updating this handbook has been drawn from many sources, including NPRs, Center systems engineering handbooks and processes, other Agency best practices, and external systems engineering textbooks and guides. This handbook consists of six chapters:  an introduction,  a systems engineering fundamentals discussion,  the NASA program project life cycles,  systems engineering processes to get from a concept to a design,  systems engineering processes to get from a design to a final product, and  crosscutting management processes in systems engineering. The chapters are supplemented by appendices that provide outlines, examples, and further information to illustrate topics in the chapters.

	abstract = {The HOSTS (Hunt for Observable Signatures of Terrestrial Systems) survey searches for dust near the habitable zones (HZs) around nearby, bright main sequence stars. We use nulling interferometry in N band to suppress the bright stellar light and to probe for low levels of HZ dust around the 30 stars observed so far. Our overall detection rate is 18\%, including four new detections, among which are the first three around Sun-like stars and the first two around stars without any previously known circumstellar dust. The inferred occurrence rates are comparable for early type and Sun-like stars, but decrease from 60 (+16/-21)\% for stars with previously detected cold dust to 8 (+10/-3)\% for stars without such excess, confirming earlier results at higher sensitivity. For completed observations on individual stars, our sensitivity is five to ten times better than previous results. Assuming a lognormal excess luminosity function, we put upper limits on the median HZ dust level of 13 zodis (95\% confidence) for a sample of stars without cold dust and of 26 zodis when focussing on Sun-like stars without cold dust. However, our data suggest that a more complex luminosity function may be more appropriate. For stars without detectable LBTI excess, our upper limits are almost reduced by a factor of two, demonstrating the strength of LBTI target vetting for future exo-Earth imaging missions. Our statistics are so far limited and extending the survey is critical to inform the design of future exo-Earth imaging surveys.},

	abstract = {The WFIRST coronagraph, currently in the design phase, will make possible for the first time the direct imaging of exoplanets down to Jupiters. The main technical challenge in direct detection comes from three areas: starlight suppression, low flux detection, and speckle stabilization in the dark zone where the planet or disk light is to be detected. These three aspects in turn place requirements on key instrument parameters such as system throughput, raw contrast and detector effects. The link between instrument limitations and instrument performance is captured in models, and balanced using error budgets. Instrument performance can be measured in terms of the science yield, which is itself limited by available mission time and the instrument sensitivity floor. In this paper, we present an overview of the modeling and methodology to assess the sensitivity of the coronagraph and some of the key results pertaining to the WFIRST coronagraph.},

The flight instrument is similar to PISCES, but there are important changes to its design as our requirements have evolved. Beginning with the science and system requirements, we discuss a number of critical trade-offs. Most significantly there are trades in the type of IFS, lenslet array shape and layout, detector sampling, and accommodating the larger Field Of View (FOV) and wider wavelength band for a potential Starshade. Finally, the traditional geometric optical design is also investigated and traded. We compare a reflective versus refractive design, and the telecentricity of the relay. The relay before the lenslet array controls the chief angle distribution on the lenslet array. Our previous paper1 has addressed how the relay design combined with lenslet array/pinhole mask can further suppress the residual star light and increase the contrast. Highlighting all of these design trades, we present the phase A IFS optical design for the WFIRST coronagraph instrument.},

It will be optimized for direct imaging and spectroscopy of potentially habitable exoplanets, and will also enable a wide range of general astrophysics science. HabEx aims to fully characterize planetary systems around nearby solar-type stars for the first time, including rocky planets, possible water worlds, gas giants, ice giants, and faint circumstellar debris disks. In particular, it will explore our nearest neighbors and search for signs of habitability and biosignatures in the atmospheres of rocky planets in the habitable zones of their parent stars. Such high spatial resolution, high contrast observations require a large (roughly greater than 3.5m), stable, and diffraction-limited optical space telescope. Such a telescope also opens up unique capabilities for studying the formation and evolution of stars and galaxies. We present some preliminary science objectives identified for HabEx by our Science and Technology Definition Team (STDT), together with a first look at the key challenges and design trades ahead.},

A ten-fold contrast improvement is therefore expected using post-processing techniques to reduce the speckle noise level to a factor of at least 10 lower in order to distinguish 10$^{\textrm{-9}}$ planets from speckles. Point spread function (PSF) subtractions have been successfully applied to ground-based and space-based data with contrasts up to 10$^{\textrm{-6}}$ but performance has yet to be demonstrated at higher contrast levels. We use both a classical PSF subtraction and the Karunhen-Lo\&\#233;ve Image Projection (KLIP) algorithm to reduce noise free WFIRST-AFTA-like simulated images in the context of reference star differential imaging (RDI). The two WFIRST-AFTA baseline coronagraphs are considered for this study: the hybrid lyot coronagraph (HLC) for the imaging channel and the shaped-pupil coronagraph (SPC) for the integral field spectrograph channel (IFS). The two reduction methods are compared with respect to the amount and stability of the aberrations for detection in the imaging channel and preliminary spectra extractions are performed for characterization in the IFS channel.},

The coronagraph employs two sequential deformable mirrors (DMs) to compensate for phase and amplitude errors in creating dark holes. DMs are critical elements in high contrast coronagraphs, requiring precision and stability measured in picometers to enable detection of Earth-like exoplanets. Working with a low-order wavefront-sensor the DM that is conjugate to a pupil can also be used to correct low-order wavefront drift during a scientific observation. However, not all actuators in a DM have the same gain. When using such a DM in low-order wavefront sensing and control subsystem, the actuator gain calibration errors introduce highspatial frequency errors to the DM surface and thus worsen the contrast performance of the coronagraph. We have investigated the effects of actuator gain calibration errors and the actuator command digitization errors on the contrast performance of the coronagraph through modeling and simulations, and will present our results in this paper.},

	abstract = {In a typical focal plane wavefront control (FPWC) system, such as the adaptive optics system of NASA’s WFIRST mission, the efficient controllers and estimators in use are usually model-based. As a result, the modeling accuracy of the system influences the ultimate performance of the control and estimation. Currently, a linear state space model is used and calculated based on lab measurements using Fourier optics. Although the physical model is clearly defined, it is usually biased due to incorrect distance measurements, imperfect diagnoses of the optical aberrations, and our lack of knowledge of the deformable mirrors (actuator gains and influence functions). In this paper, we present a new approach for measuring/estimating the linear state space model of a FPWC system using the expectation-maximization (E-M) algorithm. Simulation and lab results in the Princeton’s High Contrast Imaging Lab (HCIL) show that the E-M algorithm can well handle both the amplitude and phase errors and accurately recover the system. Using the recovered state space model, the controller creates dark holes with faster speed. The final accuracy of the model depends on the amount of data used for learning.},

To demonstrate starlight suppression in presence of expecting on-orbit input wavefront disturbances, we have built a dynamic testbed in Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in 2016. This testbed, named as Occulting Mask Coronagraph (OMC) testbed, is designed analogous to the WFIRST flight instrument architecture: It has both HLC and Shape Pupil Coronagraph (SPC) architectures, and also has the Low Order Wavefront Sensing and Control (LOWFS/C) subsystem to sense and correct the dynamic wavefront disturbances. We present upto-date progress of HLC mode demonstration in the OMC testbed. SPC results will be reported separately. We inject the flight-like Line of Sight (LoS) and Wavefront Error (WFE) perturbation to the OMC testbed and demonstrate wavefront control using two deformable mirrors while the LOWFS/C is correcting those perturbation in our vacuum testbed. As a result, we obtain repeatable convergence below 5 \&times; 10$^{\textrm{−9}}$ mean contrast with 10\% broadband light centered at 550 nm in the 360 degrees dark hole with working angle between 3 \&lambda;/D and 9 \&lambda;/D.

The LOWFS/C uses a Zernike wavefront sensor (ZWFS) with the phase shifting disk combined with the starlight rejecting occulting mask. For wavefront error corrections, WFIRST LOWFS/C uses a fast steering mirror (FSM) for line-of-sight (LoS) correction, a focusing mirror for focus drift correction, and one of the two deformable mirrors (DM) for other low order wavefront error (WFE) correction. As a part of technology development and demonstration for WFIRST Coronagraph, a dedicated Occulting Mask Coronagraph (OMC) testbed has been built and commissioned. With its configuration similar to the WFIRST flight coronagraph instrument the OMC testbed consists of two coronagraph modes, Shaped Pupil Coronagraph (SPC) and Hybrid Lyot Coronagraph (HLC), a low order wavefront sensor (LOWFS), and an optical telescope assembly (OTA) simulator which can generate realistic LoS drift and jitter as well as low order wavefront error that would be induced by the WFIRST telescope’s vibration and thermal changes. In this paper, we will introduce the concept of WFIRST LOWFS/C, describe the OMC testbed, and present the testbed results of LOWFS sensor performance. We will also present our recent results from the dynamic coronagraph tests in which we have demonstrated of using LOWFS/C to maintain the coronagraph contrast with the presence of WFIRST-like line-of-sight and low order wavefront disturbances.},

	abstract = {The Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) is baselined to incorporate a coronagraphic instrument (CGI) for high-contast imaging and spectroscopy of extrasolar planets and circumstellar dust. CGI incorporates a pair of deformable mirrors to control the wavefront of light, occulting masks that control diffraction from the obscured WFIRST aperture, and two science modes: an integral field spectrograph and a direct imager. We give an overview of CGI’s architecture and
science capabilities. CGI provides the first opportunity to fly a fully integrated active-optics coronagraph in space, paving the way for future missions such as HABEX or LUVOIR. The baseline science case includes spectroscopic characterization of known giant planets from 1-5 AU, photometric characterization of a broader sample, and searches for new lower-mass planets orbiting nearby stars. CGI will also be sensitive to extrsolar zodiacal dust associated with nearby stars, as well as debris disks and protoplanetary dust disks hosted by younger stars. These measurements will inform our understanding of planet formation and advance towards spectral characterization of earthilke planets.},

	abstract = {The Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST), which is entering Phase B for a launch in 2026, is NASA’s next large space observatory after the James Webb Space Telescope. In addition to the primary science carried out by The Wide Field Instrument (WFI), which is designed to carry out surveys of galaxies in the near infrared, explore the properties of dark energy and dark matter, and carry out a microlensing survey to complete the census of exoplanets, there will be a technology demonstration of a Coronagraph Instrument (CGI) for very high-contrast imaging and spectroscopy of nearby exoplanets. The CGI will incorporate two coronagraph types and demonstrate low- and high-order wavefront correction for the first time on a space telescope. Operating in the visible, it will consist of a direct imaging camera and a lenslet based integral field spectrograph, both using electron-multiplying CCDs in the focal plane, as well as polarizers allowing direct imaging in separate polarization states. Written by the lead science and engineering team, supported by two science investigation teams (SITs – https://wfirst.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/fswg/scienceteam.html), this paper presents an overview of the technology requirements on the instrument, the instrument design, and the operational plans to demonstrate exoplanet imaging and spectroscopic capability. Also described is how CGI will advance algorithms for extracting planet images from the background and retrieving spectra from a space IFS. Once the core performance is successfully demonstrated, CGI will also be used in the latter part of the mission for a dedicated science and Guest Observer (GO) program. This paper thus also describes the potentially revolutionary science that will be enabled through direct imaging and spectroscopy of known radial velocity planets and debris disks as seen in reflected light.},

Captured in the WFIRST Mission Requirements Document (MRD), the Level 2 CGI requirements flow from the PLRA objectives, BTRs, and BDRs.

The instrument will feature an integral field spectrograph (IFS) capable of measuring spectra from exoplanets. Since the typical exoplanet target will be dimmer than the host star by a factor of {\textasciitilde}1e9, and the dispersion of this light into many spectral channels further suppresses the photon rate, the noise requirements on the detector for this instrument will be very tight. From a performance perspective, many parameters are important, including the read noise, the dark current, and the clock induced charge. At the same time, from a functionality perspective, the unique challenges of the space environment, in particular damage from high energy cosmic rays, need to be assessed and mitigated. In this paper we present our recent work in selecting the detector for the WFIRST-AFTA IFS. We also discuss flight operation considerations and risks associated with these detectors as well as their technology readiness level.},

In this first installment of a series of three papers summarizing the outcomes of the OOC workshop, we present an overview of design methods and optical performance metrics developed for coronagraph instruments. The design and optimization of coronagraphs for future telescopes has progressed rapidly over the past several years in the context of space mission studies for Exo-C, WFIRST, HabEx, and LUVOIR as well as ground-based telescopes. Design tools have been developed at several institutions to optimize a variety of coronagraph mask types. We aim to give a broad overview of the approaches used, examples of their utility, and provide the optimization tools to the community. Though it is clear that the basic function of coronagraphs is to suppress starlight while maintaining light from off-axis sources, our community lacks a general set of standard performance metrics that apply to both detecting and characterizing exoplanets. The attendees of the OOC workshop agreed that it would benefit our community to clearly define quantities for comparing the performance of coronagraph designs and systems. Therefore, we also present a set of metrics that may be applied to theoretical designs, testbeds, and deployed instruments. We show how these quantities may be used to easily relate the basic properties of the optical instrument to the detection significance of the given point source in the presence of realistic noise.},

The AFTA coronagraph also matures direct imaging technologies to high TRL for an Exo-Earth Imager in the next decade. The coronagraph Design Reference Mission (DRM) optical design is based on the highly successful High Contrast Imaging Testbed (HCIT), with modifications to accommodate the AFTA telescope design, service-ability, volume constraints, and the addition of an Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS). In order to optimally satisfy the three science objectives of planet imaging, planet spectral characterization and dust debris imaging, the coronagraph is designed to operate in two different modes: Hybrid Lyot Coronagraph or Shaped Pupil Coronagraph. Active mechanisms change pupil masks, focal plane masks, Lyot masks, and bandpass filters to shift between modes. A single optical beam train can thus operate alternatively as two different coronagraph architectures. Structural Thermal Optical Performance (STOP) analysis predicts the instrument contrast with the Low Order Wave Front Control loop closed. The STOP analysis was also used to verify that the optical/structural/thermal design provides the extreme stability required for planet characterization in the presence of thermal disturbances expected in a typical observing scenario. This paper describes the instrument design and the flow down from science requirements to high level engineering requirements.},

Point spread function (PSF) subtractions have been successfully applied to ground-based and space-based data with contrasts up to 10$^{\textrm{-6}}$ but performance has yet to be demonstrated at higher contrast levels. We use both a classical PSF subtraction and the Karunhen-Lo\&\#233;ve Image Projection (KLIP) algorithm to reduce noise free WFIRST-AFTA-like simulated images in the context of reference star differential imaging (RDI). The two WFIRST-AFTA baseline coronagraphs are considered for this study: the hybrid lyot coronagraph (HLC) for the imaging channel and the shaped-pupil coronagraph (SPC) for the integral field spectrograph channel (IFS). The two reduction methods are compared with respect to the amount and stability of the aberrations for detection in the imaging channel and preliminary spectra extractions are performed for characterization in the IFS channel.},

Post-processing techniques that are successful on both ground-based and space-based instruments need to be validated at such high contrast levels. In this communication, we investigate speckle subtraction techniques for different observation strategies and hardware parameters on WFIRST-like simulated images in the presence of deformable mirrors and an hybrid lyot coronagraph (HLC). We compare the contrast gain after post-processing in both speckle-noise and photon-noise dominated regimes for two different observing scenarios: the reference star differential imaging (RDI) and the angular differential imaging (ADI). We find that the ADI observing strategy is more robust to speckle and photon noises than the RDI observing strategy, enabling up to a threefold gain with respect to the latter. Thus, we recommend that the telescope be able to roll by at least 13\&deg; off nominal. We investigated the impact of spatial sampling on post-processed sensitivity, in the context of design trade studies for the Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS) component of the instrument. Our preliminary results suggest that the spatial sampling can be halved from the baseline sampling rate ({\textasciitilde}4 lenslets per \&lambda;/\textit{D}) without any degradation in final contrast, thereby reducing the integration time required for spectroscopic characterization. In the speckle-noise dominated regime, we also find that at Nyquist sampling or higher, sub-pixel reference- to-target offsets have a negligible impact on the level of residual speckles after post-processing.},

	abstract = {Many distance measuring interferometers use orthogonally polarized beams in their reference and measurement arms. In practice, instrumental imperfections corrupt the polarized beam in each arm with a small amplitude signal from the other arm having the perpendicular polarization. The impact of this polarization mixing on the absolute accuracy of a single frequency laser interferometer is shown to be significantly smaller than on the accuracy of a two‐frequency interferometer. Certain signals obtained from a single‐frequency interferometer have no phase error due to polarization mixing. Other signals are affected in proportion to the ratio between the small mixing amplitudes and the primary polarization amplitudes. Roughly, those errors in the single frequency device depend on the square of the small mixing ratios while the error in the two frequency interferometer depends on a larger quantity, the sum of these ratios. For a mixing ratio of 0.1, the error in the single‐frequency interferometer is about 20 ...},

	abstract = {Dust and gas rich protoplanetary disks are the formation sites of 
planets, and are virtually ubiquitous around young stars. Understanding
these environments is crucial to determining future exoplanet
compositions, as well as uncovering the origin of Earth's organic
reservoir. In this talk, I present interferometric observations with the
Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) designed to study the signatures
of chemical complexity in protoplanetary disks. Connecting observations
of gas-phase disk organics with the bulk icy reservoir responsible for
comet formation requires constraints on abundance distributions (both
radial and vertical) and formation/destruction chemistry. First, I
present spatially resolved observations of the species H2CO and CH3CN,
assessing the relative importance of gas-phase vs. grain-surface
formation routes. I show that both processes contribute with distinct
observational signatures, but grain-surface formation is the dominant
pathway for both species. Comparing chemical model predictions of CH3CN
abundances with Solar System cometary measurements, I show that either
vigorous vertical mixing or some degree of inheritance from interstellar
ices likely occurred in the Solar Nebula. Second, a major challenge in
analyzing observations of organics in disks is that their emission is
often very weak, resulting in incomplete molecular inventories. I
present a new method for detecting weak spectral lines in
interferometric data through the use of matched filters, with possible
SNR boosts of over 500\%. Using this technique, I analyze an unbiased
ALMA spectral line survey of two protoplanetary disks, comparing their
molecular inventories and detect five new molecular species in disks, a
20\% increase in the the number of known disk species.},

Extensive individual raw contrast error sensitivities are evaluated systematically, both as known imperfections and as unknown calibration errors, for two CGI modes: spectroscopy mode and wide field-of-view mode with shaped pupil coronagraph. More than 90 distinct error items were identified, including system aberrations, optical misalignment, component fabrication errors, telescope interface related errors, etc. The result forms the basis for raw contrast error budget flow down to a sub-system level, where detailed specifications needed to aid in component design and manufacturing, mechanical alignment and instrument integration, and verification and validation operations. Evaluations are automated, making it relatively easy for repeat runs of revised design or at new desired error quantity. Observations from the comprehensive analysis and top error sensitivities and contrast floor contributors are noted and discussed. Error budget flowdown process is also briefly described.},
